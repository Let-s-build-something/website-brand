  <string name="about_content">Are you interest in what we do? Let us explain.</string>
  <string name="about_header_summary">Summary</string>
  <string name="about_content_summary">We are incredibly social beings, we like to communicate and interact with others, no matter the reason. Nowadays, this seems to happen online, particularly via instant messaging apps, forums like Reddit, or comment sections. Communicating online is relatively easy and efficient, yet it doesn't seem to be us communicating, but the online versions of us - it's the GIFs, Stickers, avatars, letters, sentences, and emojis. It may also be pretty exhausting and problematic that we decide every single thing about the interactions and how we are represented online. We should be understood, without the hustle of finding the ways to communicate it.</string>
  <string name="about_header_introduction">Why is this important? (Introduction)</string>
  <string name="about_content_introduction_0">Nearly every fourth person uses WhatsApp alone. Communication online is more relevant than ever, and we are getting in line with that. From online therapy, governmental inquiries, messaging companies via live chats, finding new friends, having dates on applications, maintaining relationships, chatting with colleagues, finding the right coffee shop, and deciding on the best vacuum cleaner, and a phone case that will protect our "precious", among others. It's just part of our society at this point, we have integrated technology into our lives, and it's a fact.</string>
  <string name="about_content_introduction_1">We, as humans are the most social species out there. This is indicated by both the brain structure and also by simply observing what we do throughout our days. Most of the activities we do are social. If we work, we work to be given money by other people and to affect other people. In the meantime, we talk about money and what we do with money with our colleagues, who seem to be in a similar position. We then spend the money either to appeal to other people (to make a picture of it and put it up online, or to have a shinier car than our neighbor) or to have a good time together with our family or friends. Paying other people in the process, who provide us the services and objects we want.</string>
  <string name="about_content_introduction_2">Communication isn't just verbal though! In fact, the starting point is nonverbal. The very first way we make sure we're safe and thus understand the world around us when we are little is through our caregiver's vocal and facial expressions. There is an underlying undertone to every expression we have, and there is a good reason for that. Importantly, we don't even think about it most of the time.</string>
  <string name="about_content_introduction_3">We want to be understood and accepted as we are. Texting someone on a dating app for a week just for them to be disappointed by how different we are is the last thing you'd like to happen to you. We also want to be affectionate to people we care about. That physical interaction with your partner you miss. The hug that your mom likely deserves. The tickle your siblings deserve. The typical you your friends are so used to meeting and making fun of.</string>
  <string name="about_header_problem">The uh-oh moment (Problem statement)</string>
  <string name="about_content_problem">So we communicate online. Efficient, fast, and easy to use, it has a history we can search through, and we can even manage how others see us. Amazing stuff. Now that isn't for free, we are losing some of that underlying tone here.
  \n    One of such big red flags is online dating. Chat with someone you're romantically interested in for two weeks and you're very likely to be a little surprised when you see them. "It is the same person as on all those social profiles, they seem to dress the same, but there's something different about them". Such experience is not uncommon. One of the reasons why, is because we have different "social profiles" (images of the other) in our minds. Now if it is someone you want to like, they want you to like (so they send the right emojis, the right messages, etc.), then you are also likely to form such an image. If you see happy, perfect images online from the person, more likely than not, this is how you imagine them to be most of the time. Another reason is, the text being sent to us doesn't have much sauce.
  \n    Well, no problem, we just add it afterward, ourselves, based on our mood, based on how we think they perceive us or how we want them to perceive us.
  \n    So you like editing or removing messages, taking your time editing them, to perfect. Swiping through pages and pages of emojis, while you still circle between the most common 3-5 ones - those are the ones everyone understands, it's a safe bet. Swiping through terabytes of GIFs and Stickers, looking for the funniest, the most expressive ones. Oh! Expressive you said? Expressive of who? Certainly not the sender, I don't think the waving Forrest Gump is the same as your grandma looking for an interaction with you (or the thousands of puppies and kitties she sends now and then). All aforementioned is explicit, meaning we have to think about every single thing we do within the interaction. Now if you compare it to the mentioned ways communication isn't just verbal, the nonverbal is predominantly implicit - not chosen to happen by choice, it just happens to be. Now this seems like a serious problem.</string>
  <string name="about_header_solution">Time for a change (Solution)</string>
  <string name="about_content_solution_0">In our opinion, the lack of implicitness and expression can be solved by adding more raw unedited information that expresses you to the interactions. However, we acknowledge there are both privacy issues and the undesirability of such a solution. Thus, another requirement of the solution is that it shouldn't expose and undercut you, instead, it should add a new value and stay at the level you are - abstract. When you read this text, it is abstract. It invokes something in you, you imagine it, analyze it, and viola a meaning! Similar to emojis, and capital letters, any other object can express sound, smell, movement, or color. A great example of this is Heider-Simmel animation.</string>
  <string name="about_content_solution_1">\n    We all know it's just a bunch of simple objects, recorded just as simply. Yet there is a story behind all of the otherwise random movements.
  \n    What we strive to do and how to solve this is thus threefold: implicit, expressive, and embedded. This goes hand in hand with user-centered design. We don't want people to be overwhelmed by the amount of information, we don't want to go against the choices users usually have, nor do we want people to have to explain themselves all the time. "What did you mean by this emoji?", "Why didn't you use emoji here and there?"</string>

  <string name="about_research_content">TBA - what this document is about</string>
  <string name="about_research_introduction_heading">Introduction</string>
  <string name="about_research_introduction_content">Communication online is more prevalent than ever, with the global user base growing exponentially each year. Notably, the most used communication application WhatsApp nearing 25% of the world's population. Not only is communication online often preferred, but it may be the only option for communication at certain periods, such as when couples are apart while at work, on public transport, or during prolonged periods, such as a pandemic. While the use of other communication channels is becoming the norm (e.g., TikTok, Instagram reels, Youtube shorts) and their use is increasingly growing, text-based communication (instant messaging) is still used predominantly for communication in one-to-one. One of the reasons likely is its advantage in privacy, as IM allows for more control. The mentioned control can become social when one considers the use of impression management (dating applications) in IM. It can also be considered easier to use, as IM allows for asynchronous communication and doesn't require a high degree of technical skills. For its ease of use, it can also be considered efficient, as there is simply a plain message, which can lead to more direct communication. Issues due to ambiguous cues (e.g., emojis, periods, commas, GIFs, images) are long-known as well.
  /n    We argue, that while additional cues are gradually being embedded into the commonly used social media software (e.g., online status, typing indicator), they are still not sufficient as expressive means of emotions, affect, state, or intention. Currently, the majority of information between people is explicitly chosen by the senders. This can not only cognitively overwhelm users, but it also leads to overuse of impression management. To solve these issues, new ways of looking at communication are needed.</string>
  <string name="about_research_content_heading">Content</string>
  <string name="about_research_content_content_0">We focus mostly on text-based communication, but many of the outcomes of our work are applicable and will apply to other communication channels.
  \nThis section will explain our approach to solving the aforementioned issues, namely, the lack of implicit expressiveness, ambiguousness, and cues.
  \n\nExpressiveness is in the context of communication a very specific way of an individual explaining their current inner state and their intentions. The contents are also altered by the current context of the situation, the environment in which it happens, affection, and the emotional state of the individual before, during, and after the matter.
  \n    Clearly, this is something connected to spontaneous bodily functions (e.g., breathing rate, heart rate, skin conductance, tone of voice, sweating, spontaneous facial expressions, and eye movement) that are usually not directly embedded in text messages. It can be relatively easily attached to messages, and/or shared between users (such as heart rate per minute) with the use of many sensors available in both smartphones and smartwatches, its presence may cause cognitive overload, likely due to difficulty with its interpretation.
  \n\nBy implicitness, we refer to the degree of attention given by the individual expressing themselves to individual cues transmitted. In other words, it is the "flow" or fluency with which the individual focuses solely on expressing themselves without giving a second thought to the way they express it. The less thought given to the means of expression, the more natural such expression usually is. Similarly, someone accustomed to the expressiveness of emojis will likely choose that means over others in times of elevated emotional states, such as sadness or anger, where people tend to choose "more automatically". Additionally, an implicit message is a message with something embedded within the message outside of the plain content. Specifically in the context of communication online, this can be for example the speed with which an individual types or responds.
  \n    This implies variability in individuals. Both in preference and the degree of habituation of the given channel of expression. How the individual sees themselves and the particular cues transmitted affect the expressions. For example, an Italian may be very expressive in his body movements while expressing himself, but with a mirror pointed at him, he may start observing the ways he expresses himself and manage the impressions others may have. Similarly, if the Italian person mentioned would be talking to someone blind and had to mention all the movements he does, it may affect the way he expresses himself.
  \n\nAmbiguity is in the context of communication online an expression lacking clarity or the mere possibility of the expression being misinterpreted (interpreted in a different way than the sender) by either party.
  \n    Certain added cues can already enforce understanding, such as emojis. Additional accurate cues that are both specific to a message and the context in which it was sent, and implicitly expressed by an individual may provide the right toolset to find patterns in expressions, something natural to humans.
  \n\nHow we initially envisioned realization was via abstract patterns of expressions. Similar to how the Heider-Simmel illusion is a means of telling a story without anything explicitly being told.</string>
  <string name="about_research_content_content_1">    This "quasi-verbal" communication can be widely seen in video games where real-time user input is reflected in the characters or objects they control. This means using high abstraction (from raw information, such as heartbeat) cues, that are communicated subtly, directly from not sender's input, but from the way the sender provides the input (the way he types, the way he handles his device, moves his mouse, etc.).
  \n    These types of simple sequences of expressions are relatively easy to interpret for the receiver and can act as a background for messages telling a story. The key here is the cognitive load of an individual it creates, as an overly animated or rich message can distract, cause misinterpretation as a whole, and be difficult to interpret at once.
  \n    Our approach will be applied to production (widely public) applications for smartphones, desktops, and smartwatches. Variability in each device is what makes this an even more interesting endeavor as users using different devices can communicate with each other at the same time. Client API and Interpreter API are what can make the communication not only implicitly expressive but also explainable both for users and researchers (e.g., for multigenerational or multicultural communication).</string>
  <string name="about_research_prospects_heading">Research prospects</string>
  <string name="about_research_prospects_content">While many researchers attempted implementing prototypes with additional cues, context, and implicity, such a strategy requires a lot of initial time investment for the prototype to be developed, and few of such prototypes can be reused and are being maintained. Notably, the prototypes lack the functionalities most used applications on the market commonly have (e.g., sending files, images, videos, GIFs, stickers, emojis, and audio recordings).
  \n    Our goal is to continuously implement experimental (not common to IMs) ways of adding cues and implicit expressiveness since this is something research indicates to be helpful. The main difference is that our applications are directed at users, not research subjects, which can be beneficial for ecological validity, yet reduces the options provided for our research if we are not to interrupt users. Yet, we think a middle ground can be found. Thus, we are working on an environment shared by users and researchers to conduct within-application studies.
  \n    The whole design of the applications is modular, and each functionality is a module that can be either included or excluded, depending on the current settings either globally or specific to a user. Each functionality will be thus tested in an environment that includes functionality common to other applications and their impacts on communication can be directly compared. Due to our user-centered approach, each functionality will still have rounds of testing and tweaking, focusing on qualitative results before it's released globally to all users outside of exceptions (such as users in ongoing research).
  \n    The outcomes of the continuous research can be both qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative outcomes will be collected with explicit knowledge of the users, who can review what is being sent for the research before it's sent and can remove it at any time. This includes questionnaires, content of messages, and any other cues both common in regular instant messaging applications, and the added cues specific to our application. Quantitive outcomes are more generalized information collected and clustered into various categories (e.g., culture, city, country, age). Such information is crucial when a researcher attempts to evaluate trends within certain social groups, global communication in general, or specific channels used and their effects on the communication, or the persons using it.
  \n    The environment is experimental, meaning researchers can file new research based on their specific needs via our custom-built research interface and directly impact the behavior of the application for specific users. Including sampling options, functionalities that will be included or functionalities that will be excluded, chatting outcomes expected (thus, what data will be stored), and the period during which research will be conducted. Access to the research interface can be provided to any researcher who is interested in such research.
  \n    It is important to note, that none of the quantitative information is directly accessible by the researcher as the information stored for research is disconnected from the instant messaging database. Neither is the information directly identifiable by legal name, username, exact address, device identifier, or database record identifiers.</string>
  <string name="about_research_options_heading">Options for other researchers</string>
  <string name="about_research_options_content">The works of our team can be re-used not as a prototype as a whole, but into existing projects and prototypes as an SDK (Software Development Kit), which can be implemented into any applications targeting Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, or Web. It is a bundle of functionalities that can be split into even smaller bundles for specific uses. Such SDKs take advantage of any input available. In terms of smartphones, many of the available sensors can be used for interpretation. And while desktop devices lack the number of sensors and thus the ease of interpretation, they can have similarly rich real-time information, such as movements of the mouse, or typing variability.
  \n    Another component that can benefit both commercial and non-commercial projects and applications is an API (Application Programming Interface). Toolset with mostly logic for evaluation, transmission of key information between devices, and other technical aspects of communication online. It is tightly connected to our Interpreter, which builds on both common contents (e.g., text, emojis, reactions, typing time, read/seen), the added cues via additional functionalities, and the context in which it happens. This provides it with unique insight into interpersonal communication. The outcomes of the Interpreter are then used to further validate and improve the interactions, and to add a layer of understanding for collected study data (such as emoji preference before and after intervention). The API also includes a statistical section, which can be used by any third party (e.g., governmental bodies, researchers, statistical tools, intervention developers) for interpretation of the communication online in general.</string>
